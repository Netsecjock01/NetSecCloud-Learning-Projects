# 2021 AWS security-focused workshops
*(https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/2021-aws-security-focused-workshops/)*

Every year, Amazon Web Services (AWS) looks to help our customers gain more experience and knowledge of our services through hands-on workshops. In 2021, we unfortunately couldnâ€™t connect with you in person as much as we would have liked, so we wanted to create and share new ways to learn and build on AWS. We built and published several security-focused workshops that help you learn how to use or configure new services and features securely. Workshops are hands-on learning modules designed to teach or introduce practical skills, techniques, or concepts you can use to solve business problems.

In this blog post, we highlight the newest AWS security-focused workshops below. There are also several other workshops that were developed before 2021; you can find them on AWS Workshops, AWS Security Workshops, and AWS Samples.
