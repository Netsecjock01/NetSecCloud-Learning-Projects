# Homelab Projects - Virtualization
*(*This is a work in progress subject to updates,changes,revisions, etc...)*

Below are hands-on task exercises I researched/complied, among others, and my part of my self-directed, personal and experimental IT homelab projects to help build/develop practical skillsets thru "tinkering" particularly in features, funtionalities or use cases in the area of computer virtualization as well as topics on computer system administration, networking, cybersecurity and cloud computing/devops, among others, as well as to help supplement/reinforce theoritical concepts, technical courses and related training I have undertaken or am currently taking in line with a favorite mantra, "Familiarity breeds mastery". It will be subject to modifications/updates periodically as my schedule or time permits:

1) Setup/installation of virtualization software and Type 2 hypervisors (VMware Workstation and/or Oracle VirtualBox) in Windows-based environment to support virtual machines (VMs)
